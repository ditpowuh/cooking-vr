      <h2>Our Evaluation</h2>
      <h3>An Introduction</h3>
      <p class="textwithlimit">
        Virtual reality, succinctly known as VR, is an innovative piece of technology that provides an immersive simulated world. And, fortunately for us, we got an opportunity to use it. But before we even got to use it, there was a lot of planning that needed to be done.
      </p>
      <h3>What is our project?</h3>
      <p class="textwithlimit">
        For our project, we decided to make a cooking simulator in virtual reality to emulate making food. We thought this would be a good idea as cooking, especially when new to it, can be a messy task and a lot of food can be wasted as a result of poor cooking. Our aim was to introduce the different concepts of cooking via an interactive simulation that emulates scenarios in the kitchen.
      </p>
      <h3>How did we go about it and what did we do in our project?</h3>
      <p class="textwithlimit">
        We first had to get the most essential part to make a VR simulation - the VR equipment itself. We would not be able to run or test anything without the headset. Getting this was relatively simple, but took some time, as we asked the Wyndham Tech School to borrow one for the time of the project. Whilst we were getting the equipment, we worked on the framework of the VR simulation, which mainly focused on the ability to look around, move around and have some sort of input from the controllers. After that was completed, we started to work on the kitchen and did 3D modelling. The start of it was slow as we were rather inexperienced with 3D modelling, but we got better and better and eventually, progress on the modelling was fluent. We also added another piece of innovative technology to enhance the project - this being an application that scans a real life object with a camera and importing it into the project. This was done with an apple, which can be seen in the project. Unfortunately with all our efforts, the VR headset did not work with our project, so we had to compromise and opt for a prototype. We instead made the project into a first person simulation that can be controlled using mouse and keyboard. By doing this, we had to convert the project, rewrite a lot of the code and write more code for the first person movement. After that, we added finishing touches and built the project (exported the project).
      </p>
      <h3>What did we do well?</h3>
      <p class="textwithlimit">
        The overall project itself was clean and visually appealing, with the kitchen looking realistic and polished. It did not contain any visual errors and the lightning generated was sensible and faithful to real life. The process of programming was smooth and plain sailing, with no issues arising there. We implemented a number of different features and it was overall most definitely functional.
      </p>
      <h3>What would have we done differently?</h3>
      <p class="textwithlimit">
        More planning on getting the equipment could have been better as we had issues with getting the VR headset. It took a lot longer than expected to do. Another point of interest would be to actually figure out what was wrong with our project connecting with the VR headset as we were not able to. We speculated that it may be due to the fact it was borrowed and there was some sort of lock. Though, we have nothing confirmed with why. If we had the opportunity to do this project again, our main goal would be to fix that issue.
